# A short adventure story in Python | Created by Bence Csomor
Contains 1 program (main.py)

The ``main.py`` program has a story where you are asked question throughout the adventure and you need to survive and choose the right answers.
Used 1 module [time] 

The program runs until the user answered the questions correctly or incorrectly. I'am planning to improve the story to be a bit longer.

I handled the return erros in the While loops and If statements. The user can input the wrong answer (not A or B) and the program will handle that.

Source code contains comments.
